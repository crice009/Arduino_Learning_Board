            I hope you enjoy these boards. They were designed to provide practice soldering, milling, and working with some of the available inputs and outputs on an Arduino.

        <h2>Double Sided Boards - order from Fab House</h2>
        <div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-around;">

        <p>
            The double sided boards give exposure to more type of inputs and outputs. They are also (probably) much easier as a first timer's exploration of soldering. Finally, since the board can be double-sided, several more components are able to be integrated
            for exploration.

        <h2>Single Sided Boards - make in local Fab Lab</h2>

        <p>
            The single sided boards offer a chance to practice milling a circuit board on your own! They also give a chance to start soldering surface mount components in the generous 1206 size. Fewer components fit, but choosing this path probably implies you know
            a thing or two about the basic components that can go with an Arduino easily.
