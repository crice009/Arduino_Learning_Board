            I hope you enjoy these boards. They were designed to provide practice soldering, milling, and working with some of the available inputs and outputs on an Arduino.

        <h2>Double Sided Boards - order from Fab House</h2>
        <div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-around;">
            <h3><a href='https://github.com/crice009/Arduino_Learning_Board/raw/master/eagle/lb_uno_v1.3_2020-07-19.zip'>Gerber Files</a></h3>

        <p>
            The double sided boards give exposure to more type of inputs and outputs. They are also (probably) much easier as a first timer's exploration of soldering. Finally, since the board can be double-sided, several more components are able to be integrated
            for exploration.

            A couple common printed circuit board fabrication companies (Fab House's) are <a href='https://jlcpcb.com/'>jlcpcb.com</a> and <a href='https://www.pcbway.com/'>pcbway.com</a>. You will upload the zipped gerber files to their website, and
            be able to adjust the settings of the boards before you order. [The default ordering options are fine, if you are unsure about the choices. However, upgrades to ROHS (reduction of hazardous substances) and lead-free are always good choices.]
            Typically, your first order will have a promo for free shipping.

        <h2>Single Sided Boards - make in local Fab Lab</h2>
        <div style="display:flex;justify-content: space-around;">
            <h3><a href='https://github.com/crice009/Arduino_Learning_Board/raw/master/eagle/single-sided_v2_production.zip'>Files for Production</a></h3>
            <h3><a href='https://github.com/crice009/Arduino_Learning_Board/blob/master/eagle/v2_bom_singlesided.csv'>Bill of Materials</a></h3>

        </div>
        <p>
            The single sided boards offer a chance to <a href='http://blog.inventables.com/2014/02/circuit-board-milling-on-shapeoko-2.html'>practice milling a circuit board on your own</a>! They also give a chance to start soldering surface mount components
            in the generous 1206 size. Fewer components fit, but choosing this path probably implies you know a thing or two about the basic components that can go with an Arduino easily.

            Some sort of CNC will be necessary to cut out these circuit boards - typically a tabletop size mill with high step accuracy. The files included for production are simple images at 1000DPI that can be converted into appropriate gcode for your local machine
            using <a href='http://mods.cba.mit.edu/'>mods</a>, <a href='http://fabmodules.org/'>fabmodules.org</a> or however you prep your Gcode. The stock material for milling the circuitboards is typically a single sided FR4 board, which
            is available for sale from <a href='https://www.digikey.com/'>digikey.com</a>, <a href='https://www.inventables.com/'>inventables.com</a> and more suppliers. Endmills will also be needed to cut the copper of the board and these are available
            from many suppliers, such as <a href='http://www.carbidedepot.com/'>carbidedepot.com</a>, <a href='https://www.inventables.com/'>inventables.com</a> and others.
