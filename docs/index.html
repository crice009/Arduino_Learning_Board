    <h1>Arduino Learning Boards!</h1>
    <p>
        I hope you enjoy these boards. They were designed to provide practice soldering, milling, and working with some of the available inputs and outputs on an Arduino.

    <h2>Double Sided Boards - order from Fab House</h2>
    <h3><a href=''>Gerber Files</a></h3>
    <p>
        The double sided boards give exposure to more type of inputs and outputs. They are also (probably) much easier as a first timer's exploration of soldering. Finally, since the board can be double-sided, several more components are able to be integrated
        for exploration.

    <h2>Single Sided Boards - make in local Fab Lab</h2>
    <h3><a href=''>Files for Production</a></h3>
    <p>
        The single sided boards offer a chance to practice milling a circuit board on your own! They also give a chance to start soldering surface mount components in the generous 1206 size. Fewer components fit, but choosing this path probably implies you know
        a thing or two about the basic components that can go with an Arduino easily.
